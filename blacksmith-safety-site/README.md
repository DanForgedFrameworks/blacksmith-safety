# Blacksmithing Starter — Safety & Setup (Static Site)

A lightweight, accessible HTML site for a beginner-friendly **"Setting up as a Blacksmith: Basic Safety & Awareness"** guide. Designed for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Download this folder and upload the contents to a new GitHub repo (e.g., `blacksmith-safety-starter`).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch → `main` / root**.
3. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/blacksmith-safety-starter/`.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Landing page & navigation
- `pages/` — Topic pages (Forge setup, PPE, Ventilation, Fire & Fuel, Materials & Handling, First Aid & Emergencies, Beginner Projects, Glossary, Resources)
- `assets/styles.css` — WCAG-conscious styles
- `assets/site.js` — small interactivity (quiz, details toggles)
- `.nojekyll` — Ensures GitHub Pages serves files as-is
- `CNAME` — (optional) put your custom domain here (e.g., `forge.wigswonkyforge.uk`)

## Editing
Open the HTML files in any editor. Replace placeholder text with your content. Use British English.

## Notes
- This is **not** a legal or compliance document. Always check current HSE/COSHH guidance, local regulations, and manufacturer manuals.
- Add high-resolution images with clear **alt text**.
- Keep colour contrast at least **4.5:1** and ensure keyboard access to any interactive components.
